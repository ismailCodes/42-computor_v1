The purpose of this project is to make the student code a program that solves simple equations.
The program takes a polynomial equation. That is to say, involving only powers, no
complicated functions. The program should display its solution(s).

Why polynomials? Because it is one of the simplest and most powerful mathematical
tools. It is used in all domains and at all levels to simplify and express many things. For
example, the functions sin, cos, and tan are computed using polynomials.
